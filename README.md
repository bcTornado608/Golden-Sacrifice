# GoldenSacrifice
Respawn in the help of a mythical natural force...

A Paper MC plugin for Minecraft version 1.20+

## Why?
I like hardcore mode, but in multiplayer mode, one person's death interrupt the entire game. /gamemode works, but feels like cheating, and sometimes make the hardcore mode not so hardcore.

I want a better, more vanilla way to respawn.

It should be hard enough so death is never wanted, but should not be too hard that people want to give up the world.

And this is the solution.
